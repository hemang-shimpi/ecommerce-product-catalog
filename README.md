# Ecommerce Product Catalog Project
### Developed a product catalog using Spring Boot and a React.js frontend for browsing and filtering tech products.
### Implemented user authentication with Spring Security and JWT, allowing users to register and log in to view product details.
### Connected to a PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA to store product information, and deployed the app locally using Docker.
